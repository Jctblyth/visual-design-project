        I decided to create a hero image which would serve as the header for my website. As this would be the first thing a hypothetical customer would see upon opening the website I wanted it to really capture the essence of the brand. I decided to therefore use a background of tropical leaves, with the name of the website on top.

To make the font easily legible I added a filter to the image by creating an extra layer, filling it with a colour from my colour scheme, and reducing the opacity to 50%. I then added the text in white. I chose to use the font “Fashion Stamp” for the logo and title of my website. The aesthetics of the site is a vintage travel feel, and this font, which I sourced from DaFont, seemed to echo this well.

        I created a logo for the brand to be used in online marketing materials. I used the same font as the hero image and selected a colour from the same palette I created using the canvas print as inspiration. 



I created a hand painted watercolour of a pink tropical flower based on an image I found online. I took a photo of this painting, uploaded to my computer and used photoshop to cut it out and create a PNG using the quick selection tool. I then duplicated this cutout and added it to the logo, flipping the two left hand side PNGs so they faced the opposite direction. I created a square and circular version of my logo to be used in different contexts. 



I saved the round logo for web as a PNG-8 as it is a small icon which doesn’t require a lot of colour detail. I saved the square version for web as a medium quality JPEG in 1000x1000 pixels, as it will not need to be displayed at a particularly high resolution in most cases.

        I decided to illustrate the different locations that the travel agency promotes by creating postcard images, in keeping with the vintage aesthetics of the website.



To do so I sourced images of three different locations. I converted them to black and white using the desaturate tool. I adjusted the levels and brightness and contrast to make the details stand out more. I then used the “Oil Paint” filter to make the images look like they were on a canvas. 



I separately sourced some postcard vectors and a stamp vector. I cut the blank stamp out using the quick selection tool. I decided I wanted to add some flower detail to each stamp. From the photo of the original canvas poster that I used as inspiration for the aesthetic of the website I cut out three flowers using the quick selection tool and the refine edge tool, as the images were quite complex to cut out. I then added combined each black and white image, the cut out blank stamp and the cut out flower into one PSD file to create the final postcard.



I also added text in one of the fonts I sourced online to describe the location. I saved each PSD for web as a high quality JPEG as these will appear quite large on the website and are fairly detailed.

        Poster images

I decided to create a series of images to represent different destinations which could illustrate relevant blog posts on the website.



In keeping with the vintage theme of the website I decided to mimic the aesthetics of vintage travel posters for these images.



I did this by sourcing relevant destination images from Getty Images and manipulating them with a range of filters in photoshop to create a painting effect. For the first two destinations the steps were as follows:





<div> 

<ul id = "poster-list">
<li>Converted image to smart object</li>
<li>Opened filter gallery and selected ‘dry brush’ and applied</li>
<li>Opened filter gallery again selected the ‘cutout’ filter and applied</li>
<li>Changed the blending mode to Pin Light in the Layers panel</li>
<li>Opened filter menu and selected Blur - smart blur</li>
<li>Changed the blending mode of the Smart Blur filter to an opacity of 50%</li>
<li>Applied Stylize - find edges from the filter menu and changed the blending mode to multiply</li>
<li>Sourced a jpeg of plain, textured paper, added this as an additional layer on top of the destination image and changed the blending mode to Multiply</li>
<lli>Opened the brushes menu and selected a watercolour style brush</li>
<li>Painted over the image manually to create the watercolours aesthetic with the rough edges</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div>
      <p id="body-text">
For the third image I followed the same steps but stopped after applying the Cut Out filter. This is because I liked how it looked at this stage with a more modern, bold style that complemented the hues in the poster.



I then applied the names of each location in a font that I thought best matched the style of the poster - all of which I downloaded from DaFonts
