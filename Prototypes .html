	<h2> Mock Ups</h2>
	<div>
	<p id="body-text">
	I decided to create a website and branding concept for a travel agency called “Tropicalia”. While I was considering the branding aesthetics I took inspiration from a hanging canvas poster I own of some tropical plants. I liked the vintage look of the poster and the colour scheme. From a photo of this canvas I created a colour scheme using the free website https://coolors.co/. I used this colour scheme as the basis for many of my images and for the XD mock ups.



Below are four XD mock ups showing the concept for the website, including a homepage with search bar, a page showcasing the destinations available, a blog page for SEO purposes and to serve as travel inspiration for potential customers, and a contact us page.



Each page has a header which shows the hero image I created with the “Tropicalia” brand name and a navigation bar underneath. I downloaded several fonts from Dafonts website which I felt were in-keeping with the general aesthetics of the brand. I created all page in the DIMENSIONS. Each page also includes a footer with icon links to the brand’s social media pages.



The homepage includes space for text introducing the company and directly below a search bar so that customers can quickly find a destination they are interested in.



Beneath there are some roundel images which would link to different destination pages and serve as inspiration if someone is coming to the site without a clear idea of where they want to travel to.
